### Day 1: July 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
1. Finished entire Basic HTML and HTML5 lesson, 100% progress 
2. Started first Basic CSS lessons, stopped at 9% progress

**Thoughts** I've coded before, but it's been a long time since I have done so. Need to keep up this consistent habit. Worked pretty quickly through the HTML lessons. Excited to work on CSS over the weekend!

1. Linking to Internal Anchor Elements was difficult, but really interesting. I've wondered how this works for the longest time! [Link] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-internal-sections-of-a-page-with-anchor-elements)



### Day 2: August 1, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

2. Started first Applied Vidual Design lessons, stopped at 17% progress

**Thoughts** 
CSS was a lot of info but another nice fresher course. Think I'm moving on to new grounds now. Confusing to remember the differences between elements, attributes, div classes, variables, etc.
