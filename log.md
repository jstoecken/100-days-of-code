### Day 1: July 31, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

1. Finished entire Basic HTML and HTML5 lesson, 100% progress 
2. Started first Basic CSS lessons, currently at 9% progress

**Thoughts** I've coded before, but it's been a long time since I have done so. Need to keep up this consistent habit. Worked pretty quickly through the HTML lessons. Excited to work on CSS over the weekend! 

**Link(s) to work**
1. Linking to Internal Anchor Elements was difficult, but really interesting. I've wondered how this works for the longest time! [Link] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-internal-sections-of-a-page-with-anchor-elements)
